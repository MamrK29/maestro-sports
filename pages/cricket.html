    <h2>History Created Down Under</h2>

    <br>
    <p>For the first time, India has managed to win a test series in Australia thanks
      to the efforts of the entire team.  Under Kohli's captaincy,
      India played a high-quality brand of cricket, which was applauded by everyone
      including ex Australian players.  No doubt it was a weakened Australian side without
      Warner and Smith but they still had the best bowling quartet going around in the
      international circuit. Starc, Hazlewood, Cummins, and Lyon can terrorise any batting
      line-up in the world, as England found out in last years Ashes.
      This series though they came up against a wall, Mr Cheteshwar Pujara, who blunted
      the Australian attack with infinite patience and focus.</p>
      <br>
      <p>The Indian batting on this tour was the difference because after failing in
        South Africa and England they finally took the burden off Kohli and batted
        responsibly. In the previous two tours it was only Kohli and the bowlers
        who were performing, and once everyone else started performing you could see the
        difference. Pujara, in particular, was a class above the rest and his three hundred's
        and a fifty was what put India in the driver's seat.  He displayed a high level of patience
        and concentration and he wore down the Australian attack with his compact defence.
        Pujara's county stint with Yorkshire has improved him as a player as he is not dismissed LBW
        and bowled as much anymore due to the fine-tuning of his footwork and defence thanks to
        playing in England all summer with India and his county Yorkshire.  In this series, Pujara
        was consistently able to convert his slow starts into hundreds which made him a more
        significant threat than Kohli this series.  Pujara is probably the most improved player
        over the last year and that's thanks to his dedication to test cricket and the willingness
        to work hard on his weaknesses. Mind you, after this series Pujara will being receiving quite
        few phone calls from cement and glue companies after the grit and determination he showed to
        stay on the pitch throughout the series. Most runs in the series, most balls face, the most
        hours spent at the crease by a batsman, Pujara was indeed the man of the series.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The openers slot was a huge issue in the first couple of games, with Shaw injured and
          both Rahul and Vijay failing consistently. In came the young Mayank Agarwal who took
          the Boxing Day Test by storm as he scored a wonderful fifty on debut and gave India the
          start they were desperate for all year.  Agarwal balanced both defence and attack
          beautifully and he did not look like a debutant in either of the two games he played
          this series.  It just goes to show the strength of first-class cricket in India and the
          talent available, also credit must go to Kohli and the team management for having faith
          in the youngsters and believing that they can perform on the biggest stage. Agarwal saw
          off the new ball in the first innings of both the third and fourth test and this gave the
          likes of Pujara, Kohli and Rahane some respite and allowed them to come in with less
          pressure on their shoulders.

          Rishab Pant's contribution has been immense as well for India, he does need to work on
          both his keeping and batting but on his first tour of Australia, the youngster has done
          remarkably well.  It is not easy to keep on Australian wickets, and Pant did a great job
          especially in Perth, on a bouncy pitch as he was diving away and collecting the ball neatly.
          He contributed in every game with the bat with twenties and thirties and considering he was batting
          with the tail mostly that is a decent effort.  Let us not forget in the last test of the series
          he scored a squash buckling 150 and that inning was just proof that he has it in him to play
          test cricket and that he will learn from his mistakes as he matures.

          This bowling attack has been sensational all year, since the start of the South Africa tour,
          especially this fast bowling unit is the best India has ever produced. Mohammed Shami,
          Ishant Sharma and Jasprit Bumrah have all been brilliant and most importantly they formed
          bowling partnerships to trap the batsmen. It was a rare sight to see Indian fast bowlers
          beat the opposition batsmen with raw pace and bounce.  The two key difference between India
          and Australia's attack was that firstly the Indian bowlers attacked the stumps more which
          gave them more opportunities for bowled and LBW dismissals, whereas the Australian batsmen
          were a tad short and wide, containing the batsmen but not necessarily getting them out.
          Secondly, the Indian bowlers used the older ball much better and especially the likes of
          Shami got the ball to reverse which made it even more difficult for the batsmen.
          The spinners bowled really well throughout the series, Ashwin was good at Adelaide but then
          got injured.  Jadeja took over in Melbourne and used the rough brilliantly to dismiss the
          batsmen and he was joined by Kuldeep in the final test at Sydney, who picked up a five-wicket
          haul with brilliant flight and guile which deceived the batsmen.

          Cannot end without talking about the captain himself, Virat Kohli, who did not have
          a brilliant series with the bat to his standards, but as a captain, he improved leaps
          and bounds from the previous tour.  The best thing was that Kohli learnt from his mistakes,
          he was not too defensive against the tail in Australia, and although they bothered him here
          as well it was not as dangerous because he looked to attack them instead of containing them.
          His bowling changes were top drawer throughout the series, and he knew when to rotate his fast
          bowlers and always backed them to bowl aggressively and look for wickets.
          His field placements improved a lot, not only with the tail-enders but also with the specialist
          batsmen as both Finch and Labuchagne fell into the trap of flicking the ball to short mid-wicket.
          Kohli has been criticised a lot for team selection, but in Australia, he got that right as well
          as he took a massive risk in dropping his two openers for the Boxing Day Test and going with a
          debutant in Mayank Agarwal and Hanuma Vihari who usually slots in at number six.
          Also playing Kuldeep in the final test instead of a third seamer raised quite a few eyebrows,
          but Kohli won the toss and Kuldeep ended up with a five-for, and the rest is history.
          These decisions turned out to be masterstrokes, sometimes results do not go your way and you
          get heavily criticised for your choices but Kohli is never worried about taking risks as long
          as it gives his team a chance to win.  Kohli's passion for test cricket has rubbed off on
          the rest of the team, and you could see how much this series win meant to each and every
          player. There is still room for improvement for this Indian team but they can use this series
          win as great motivation to succeed in future test matches.</p>
